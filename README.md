Below is a simple README file example that guides a user on how to compile and run a chat server and a corresponding chat client application using a Makefile, a server executable, and a Python script for the client. This README assumes you have a directory structure where `make` can be used to compile your server code (likely written in C or C++), and you have a Python script for the client.

# Chatroom Application

This is a simple chat application that consists of a server and a client. The server handles messages between multiple clients connected to it. The client program allows users to connect to the server, join chatrooms, and exchange messages.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following installed:
- GCC compiler (for compiling the server)
- Python 3.x (for running the client)
- Make (for building the server)

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Compiling the Server

1. Open a terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the server code.
3. Run the following command to compile the server:

   ```
   make
   ```

This command uses the `Makefile` to compile the server code and generate an executable named `server`.

### Running the Server

After compiling the server, you can start it by running:

```
./server
```

This command starts the server, which will listen for incoming client connections. Keep this terminal open to keep the server running.

### Running the Client

Open a new terminal window and follow these steps to run the client application:

1. Ensure you are in the directory containing the `ClientMsg.py` Python script.
2. Run the client by executing the following command:

   ```
   python3 ClientMsg.py
   ```

This will launch the client application. Follow the on-screen prompts to enter a username and chatroom name to start chatting.
